Time is of the essence. All understandings between the Parties are incorporated in this Agreement. Its terms are intended by the Parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of their Agreement with respect to its subject matter and they may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| XX.    | BUYER'S DEFAULT. Seller's remedies shall be limited to liquidated damages in the amount of the Earnest Money set forth in Section IV. It is agreed that such payments and things of value are liquidated damages and are Seller's sole and only remedy for Buyer's failure to perform the obligations of this Agreement. The Parties agree that Seller's actual damages in the event of Buyer's default would be difficult to measure, and the amount of the liquidated damages herein provided for is a reasonable estimate of such damages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| XXI.   | SELLER'S DEFAULT. Buyer may elect to treat this Agreement as cancelled, in which case all Earnest Money paid by Buyer hereunder shall be returned and Buyer may recover such damages as may be proper, or Buyer may elect to treat this Agreement as being in full force and effect and Buyer shall have the right to specific performance or damages, or both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| XXII.  | EARNEST MONEY DISPUTE. Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Parties agree that in the event of any controversy regarding the release of the Earnest Money that the matter shall be submitted to mediation as provided in Section XXIII.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| XXIII. | DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Buyer and Seller agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement, or in any resulting transaction, before resorting to arbitration or court action. a.) Mediation. If a dispute arises, between or among the Parties, and it is not resolved prior to or after recording, the Parties shall first proceed in good faith to submit the matter to mediation. Costs related to mediation shall be mutually shared between or among the Parties. Unless otherwise agreed in mediation, the Parties retain their rights to proceed to arbitration or litigation.                                                                                                                                                              |\n|        | b.) Arbitration. The Parties agree that any dispute or claim in law or equity arising between them out of this Agreement or any resulting transaction, which is not settled through mediation, shall be decided by neutral, binding arbitration. The arbitrator is required to be a retired judge or justice, or an attorney with at least five (5) years of residential real estate law experience unless the Parties mutually agree to a different arbitrator. Under arbitration, the Parties shall have the right to discovery in accordance with Governing Law. Judgment upon the award of the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court having jurisdiction. Enforcement of this Agreement to arbitrate shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. |\n\nNE\n\nBuyer's Initials NP - Seller's Initials\n\nPage 7 of 10"
