# Function to analyze signatures in a document using LangGraph agent
# This function creates a LangGraph agent that uses the document_markdown_tool from langchain_tensorlake

# The agent is designed to handle questions related to signature detection, such as the number of signatures
# found, the parties involved, and any missing signatures.
