### 5. Run the example in a Streamlit application
You can also interact with the Signature Detection System via a beautiful web UI built using Streamlit. Simply run:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will launch a browser interface that allows you to:
 - Upload and process documents using Tensorlake AI
 - View signature analysis results in a structured format
 - Chat with an intelligent assistant (LangGraph agent) about the signatures and document content
