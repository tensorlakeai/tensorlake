# TensorLake Image Builder Client
# This code is part of the TensorLake SDK for Python.
# It provides a client for interacting with the image builder service.

# This client is a new revision of the client found in `src/tensorlake/builder/client.py`.
# It is designed to interact with the /images/v2 API endpoint.
# The client allows users to build images, check the status of builds,
# and stream logs from the image builder service.

# The client is initialized with the build service URL and an optional API key.
# The API key is used for authentication when making requests to the service.
# The client provides methods to get build information, check if a build exists,
# and stream logs from a build.
