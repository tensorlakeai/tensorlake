    Filter for dataset data retrieval.

    Attributes:
      cursor: Optional cursor for pagination. If provided, the method will return the next page of
          results starting from this cursor. If not provided, it will return the first page of results.

      direction: Optional pagination direction. If provided, it can be "next" or "prev" to navigate through the pages.

      limit: Optional limit on the number of results to return. If not provided, a default limit will be used.

      file_name: Optional filename to filter the results by. If provided, only parse results associated with this filename will be returned.

      status: Optional status to filter the results by. If provided, only parse results with this status will be returned.

      created_after: Optional timestamp to filter the results by creation time. If provided, only parse results created after this timestamp will be
          returned. The date should be in RFC3339 format (e.g., "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z").

      created_before: Optional timestamp to filter the results by creation time. If provided, only parse results created before this timestamp will be
          returned. The date should be in RFC3339 format (e.g., "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z").

      finished_after: Optional timestamp to filter the results by finish time. If provided, only parse results finished after this timestamp will be
