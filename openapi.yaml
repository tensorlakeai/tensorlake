                    This field must be provided if the `file_id` is not provided.

                    The file should be a binary file, and it will be uploaded to the server.
                file_id:
                  type:

                    The Tensorlake file ID to ingest into the dataset.

                    This field must be provided if the `file` is not provided.

                    The file ID should be a valid Tensorlake file ID.
                    A valid file ID is a string that starts with `tensorlake-` (if uploaded
                    via Files V1), or `file_` (if uploaded via Files V2); followed by a
                    readable identifier.

                  type:

                  description: |-
                    The page range to ingest into the dataset.

                    This field is optional and defaults to `None`, which means all pages
                    will be ingested. If provided, it should be a string in the format
                    "start-end", where `start` and `end` are page numbers. For example,
                    "1-10" will ingest pages 1 to 10.
                labels:
                  type:
                    - object
                    - "null"
                  description: |-
                    The labels to apply to the ingest operation of the file.

                    Labels should be in the format of key=value pairs, e.g. key1=value1; or
                    as a JSON object.

                    For adding multiple labels, use different form-data fields with the same
                    key.

                    Example:
                    POST /documents/v1/files
                    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----boundary

                    ------boundary
                    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="labels"
                    owner=JohnDoe

                    ------boundary
                    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="labels"
                    project=Tensorlake

                    Labels can also be provided as a JSON object:
                    ------boundary
                    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="labels"
                    {"owner": "JohnDoe", "project": "Tensorlake"}

                    Labels are optional and can be used to store additional information
                    about the file.

        This endpoint is the first step in the upload process. There are a total of
        3 steps:
        1. **Upload File Init**: This endpoint is called first to initiate the
           upload process. The response
         contains a presigned URL that can be used to upload the file.
        2. **Upload File**: The file is uploaded to the presigned URL. This should
           be done using a
        multipart/form-data request via a PUT request.
        3. **Upload File Finalize**: This endpoint is called to finalize the upload
           process. It verifies the
        file and updates the database with the file information.

        This object defines the request body for creating a new dataset.

        A Dataset is a collection of parsed results from files.

        It can be used to store and manage related data, such as invoices, receipts,
        or any other documents that need to be parsed and analyzed.

        Once a dataset is created, you can use it to parse related files using the
        same configuration and options, allowing for consistent and efficient data
        extraction.

      type: object
      required:
        - schema_name
        - json_schema
      properties:
        schema_name:
          type: string
          description: |-
            The name of the schema. This is used to tag the structured data output
            with a name in the response.
        json_schema:
          description: |-
            The JSON schema to guide structured data extraction from the file.

            This schema should be a valid JSON schema that defines the structure of
            the data to be extracted.

            The API supports a subset of the JSON schema specification.

            This value must be provided if `structured_extraction` is present in the
            request.
        skip_ocr:
          type: boolean
          description: |-
            Boolean flag to skip converting the document blob to OCR text before
            structured data extraction.

            If set to `true`, the API will skip the OCR step and directly extract
            structured data from the document.

            The default is `false`.
        prompt:
          type:
            - string
            - "null"
          description: |-
            The prompt to use for structured data extraction.

            If not provided, the default prompt will be used.
        model_provider:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Model"
          description: |-
            The model provider to use for structured data extraction.

            The default is `tensorlake`, which uses our private model, and runs on
            our servers.
        partition_strategy:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/ChunkingStrategy"
          description: |-
            Strategy to partition the document before structured data extraction.
            The API will return one structured data object per partition. This is
            useful when you want to extract certain fields from every page.
            Options -
            * `None`(*default*) - no partitioning is applied.
            * `Page` - partition the document into pages.
        page_classes:
          type:
            - array
            - "null"
          items:
            type: string
          description: |-
            Filter the pages of the document to be used for structured data
            extraction by providing a list of page classes.

            The default is `None`, which means all pages will be used.
