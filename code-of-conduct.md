# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the Tensorlake SDK project pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, harassment-free, and inclusive experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate
- Using inclusive language
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Acknowledging the contributions of others
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary jokes or language
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., addresses or phone numbers) without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, pull requests, issues, discussions, and other communication channels, as well as in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Tensorlake team at [support@tensorlake.ai](mailto:support@tensorlake.ai). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of reporters.
